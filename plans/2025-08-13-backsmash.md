## What to train?
Prioritize back and rehab. Plan rehab for the following:
- Lower back
- Knee and hip
- Left elbow
- Rotator cuff
- Serratus anterior

## How to train?
Myorep sets but lengthened partials for the makeup reps.
The set/rep scheme for individual exercises needs to be added.

## The plan
I still need to add the rehab plan.
