# Training
*Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.* - Arthur Ashe

## How to train?
There are infinite ways to train. So, coming up with a holistic regimen is a
difficult task. For example, an incomplete list of types of fitness might
include strength, endurance, speed, power, agility, flexibility, coordination,
and aesthetics. One could be training all day every day and still overlook
certain aspects. This is not to demoralize myself or anybody else but to state
that there is no right answer. The best thing to do is to get started with
anything and add more things to the routine feasibly. Long story short, start
with three things: strength training, cardiovascular training, and a sport
(hopefully a less injury-prone one) you like.
