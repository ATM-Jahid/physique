# Training
*Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.* - Arthur Ashe

## How to train?
There are infinite ways to train. So, coming up with a holistic regimen is a
difficult task. For example, an incomplete list of types of fitness might
include strength, endurance, speed, power, agility, flexibility, coordination,
and aesthetics. One could be training all day every day and still overlook
certain aspects. This is not to demoralize myself or anybody else but to state
that there is no right answer. The best thing to do is to get started with
anything and add more things to the routine feasibly. Long story short, start
with three things: strength training, cardiovascular training, and a sport
(hopefully a less injury-prone one) you like.

## When to train?
Binding training sessions, especially strength training, to the days of the
week doesn't seem to be a good option for me for several reasons.
- First, I cannot follow the weekly routine properly for more than a month
because of travel or work.
- Second, I either have to workout 4/5 days in a row to get back on schedule or
skip a few sessions.
- Third, the exhaustion from just maintaining the strength routine leaves me
unable to focus on other aspects of physical fitness, such as cardio and
mobility.

One possible remedy from this predicament is not to tie strength training to
specific days. If there is a list of training sessions, one can cycle through
them as necessary. However, not thinking about which days to workout on
altogether can lead to laziness. Before you know it, you might be training only
two days per week. To prevent this, designate 3/4 days of the week as training
days but without any association to a specific training session.
