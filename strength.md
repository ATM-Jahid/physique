## What to train?
Everything! For now though, focus on back and shoulders. Eliminate lat
tightness, which is probably a key factor in bad pullup form.

## How to train?
Apply GZCL principles. Have T2 and T3 exercises only. The T2s define if it's an
upper or a lower body day. The T3s can be anything on any day. Since we are not
competing, not having T1s will save time and reduce injuries. I want to
implement myorep match sets, but it might be overkill for T2 exercises. Some T2
exercises might benefit from it, such as incline bench press. Leg exercises,
such as squats, might kill you if you have myorep match sets. So, let's
experiment and see.

Use supersets. It saves more time than you think it does. Get out of your
comfort zone. Even if your limbs are going numb, do your supersets. Now, the
main problem is making a progression plan for single limb exercises. How do we
count reps? How many reps and sets do we do? Also, lunges and single arm rows
are performed differently. Don't worry about having a unified scheme for all T2
and T3 exercises. It's difficult and hard to maintain. Write down a set/rep and
progression scheme for all exercises individually. If you are not challenged
after performing the exercise, change it.
